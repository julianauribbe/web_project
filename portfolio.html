              These are my Photoshop images that I have created with multiple
              layers using Adobe Photoshop.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first image was created using my own natural soap company as
              inspiration, for our scent Northern Pine. I used a stock image of
              a lake with mountains in the back, and added all the elements to
              the image, such as the deck, the golden retriever, the smoke on
              top of the mountain, sky with stars, moon, cloud, man on a boat, a
              fish beign caught, a cabin, and a pine cone.
            </p>
            <p>
              The second image was a project where I had to recreate a poster
              for the movie "The Passanger". In this assignment I used different
              images and merged them together. I had to remove the background
              from some of them on Photoshop, and also work with text, shadows,
              and many other elements.

              This is my Stop Motion video that I created with over 100
              photographs.
            </p>
            <p>
              I used my tripod to guarantee that the images would be always
              aligned, so that the transition between them would be seemless.
              The only thing I wish I had done is used a professional camera to
              take the pictures, instead of an iPhone.

              For this project I also used my own natural soap company as
              inspiration and used the products that we sell to promote a Spring
              Sale discount code.

              This is my Video video I have created for my final Video
              Assignment.
            </p>
            <p>
              This assignment consisted in making a video with any chosen
              concept and idea. It just had to follow some guidelines, as for
              example, being between 1-2 minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
              For this video, I came up with a story of a girl, named Emily, who
              had lost her grandmother recently. They used to play chess
              together, and she leard a lot from her grandma lessons. The story
              takes a twist and we see Emily playing with the ghost of her
              grandmother.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project was very interesting and fun to make, I was able to
              let my creativity shine, and to use my knowledge that I have
              already filming for social media. I used a tripod to film a steady
              video. Used multiple angles, to keep the watcher engaged.
            </p>
            <p>
              I edited this video using Premier Pro and Rush. I cropped all the
              footage I created, used some masking technique to be able to
              create the ghost effect on the grandma, used a song that fit the
              theme of the story, and edited the video color grade to make it
              look more cinematic.
